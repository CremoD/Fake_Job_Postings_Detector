# Fake_Job_Postings_Detector

Machine Learning project, exploiting the "Fake Real Job Postings Prediction" dataset, retrieved on Kaggle at the following address: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction).

The dataset contains about 18.000 job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs.

The goal of the project is to build a classification model that, learning from the different job posting attributes (both textual and meta-information), is able to predict whether a job posting is fake or real.
